# Health Management System

Data Modelling

For this stage of our HMS project, we will start working on defining the shape of the data that will flow through the server.  

We do this operation by creating models or entities that will be used to complete the tasks to be performed by our Health Management System. 

The models are subject to change in a different stage of the project
