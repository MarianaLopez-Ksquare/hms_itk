# Health Management System

Data Modelling

For this stage of our HMS project, we will start working on defining the shape of the data that will flow through the server.  

We do this operation by creating models or entities that will be used to complete the tasks to be performed by our Health Management System. 

The models are subject to change in a different stage of the project 

Requirements 

Use interfaces or types to declare your models based on TypeScript

    *Patient Module
        -Create appointments
        -See their appointments history

    *Doctor Module
        -Can see their appointments
        -Can serch / filter for a specif appointment by id

    *Admin Module
        -Can see all patients with filters
        -Can see all doctors with filters
        -Can see all appointments with filter
        -Can add new doctors


    
Create a README.md file in which you will write your models and justifications 

For every single model that you create, write why or what this model would be useful
